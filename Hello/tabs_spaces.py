# Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format:
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
#   How I wonder what you are!
#       Up above the world so high,
#       Like a diamond in the sky.
#Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
#   How I wonder what you are

#This program gives you a simple idea how to use next line using '\n' and tab using '\t'
#One can also use this to write patterns.

print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n\tHow I wonder what you are!\n\t\tUp above the world so high,\n\t\tLike a diamond in the sky.\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,\n\t How I wonder what you are!")
